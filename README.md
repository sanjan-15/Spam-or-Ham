# Advanced Spam Email Detector 🛡️

A web-based application that uses a machine learning model to classify emails as **SPAM** or **HAM** (not spam). Users can upload one or more PDF copies of emails, and the app will analyze the content, providing a classification for each file along with a confidence score. Batch upload results are summarized in a visual chart.

***

## Features ✨

- **Spam/Ham Classification**: Utilizes a Multinomial Naive Bayes model trained on the TREC 2007 Public Corpus to classify email text.
- **Confidence Score**: Displays the model's confidence percentage for each prediction.
- **Batch PDF Upload**: Supports uploading and classifying multiple PDF files simultaneously.
- **Results Visualization**: Summarizes batch classification results with a dynamic pie chart.
- **Clean UI**: Features a modern and responsive interface for smooth user experience.

***

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK, NumPy
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Visualization**: Chart.js
- **PDF Processing**: PyPDF2
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Setup and Installation 🚀

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd project-1
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment for dependencies.

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install flask scikit-learn pandas nltk numpy PyPDF2 joblib
```

### 4. Download NLTK Data

In a Python shell, run:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
```

### 5. Train the Model (Optional)

Pre-trained models are included in the `saved_models/` directory.  
To retrain, run all cells in `notebook/spam_model_training.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.

***

## How to Use the Application

### 1. Start the Flask Server

```bash
cd app
python app.py
```

### 2. Open the Application

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser.

### 3. Upload Emails

Click the file input area to select one or more PDF files from your computer.

### 4. Analyze

Click the **Analyze Emails** button to start the classification process.

### 5. View Results

See a table showing filename, prediction (**SPAM/HAM**), and confidence score for each file.  
A pie chart summarizes the batch results.
